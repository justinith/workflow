Project Proposal: Workflow
## Synopsis

Workflow is the improved planner/calendar that allows people to have a macro view of a user’s ongoing individual projects in each class or personal category.  As a group, we all noticed a significant lack of cohesion in our current personal scheduling and planning techniques; our information was not in one place, which made it difficult to remember everything that needed to be done. A defining feature of this product is the ability to insert different phases within projects into the user’s daily scheduled routine.  This allows for a centralized location in which to schedule and plan the different sectors of the busy life of its user.

## Motivation
Nowadays, people usually have multiple projects that have their own workflow and timeline, as well as various small to-do tasks that do not necessary have a due date. We wanted to address how a calendar could potentially help people better organize their life, moreover, improve schedule effectiveness and efficiency by minimizing stress and keeping everything in one place.
